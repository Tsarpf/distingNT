## Dependencies
[spn_to_c](https://github.com/expertsleepersltd/spn_to_c)

arm-none-eabi toolchain, installed via [MCUXpresso IDE](https://www.nxp.com/design/design-center/software/development-software/mcuxpresso-software-and-tools-/mcuxpresso-integrated-development-environment-ide:MCUXpresso-IDE)

After installing the IDE, read "MCUXpresso_IDE_Installation_Guide.pdf" and find the "Command line use" section that applies to your platform.

On macOS, note that the "MCUXpressoPath.sh" script is for bash, so it will not work with the macOS default zsh. Switch to bash before sourcing the script.

To use the Makefile on Windows you'll need to use a Linux subsystem of some sort e.g. Cygwin.
